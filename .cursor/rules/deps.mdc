# Your rule content

- when creating h1-h6 tags, use the [typography.tsx](mdc:components/common/typography.tsx) component
- when creating things like buttons, inputs, forms, etc, always try to use a shadcn ui element if it already exists in the codebase
- when creating a new component that should be wrapped in a section, use the [section.tsx](mdc:components/common/section.tsx) component instead of a default <section>
- for components requiring user interaction or client components add "use client" to the top of the script
